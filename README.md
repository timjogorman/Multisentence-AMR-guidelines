# Document Level AMR annotations
This is intended to be the living document for preliminary version of the multi-sentence AMR guidelines, and for later "Richer Event Description" guidelines that will be annotated on top of that

* Use the Issues page to post questions, comments, and things that seem inconsistent or hard to annotate.  
* Consult the [inital guidelines](ms-amr.md) for how to annotate MS-AMR documents.
* Visit the [Anafora site](https://github.com/weitechen/anafora) if you are intereted in setting up your own RED annotation.
